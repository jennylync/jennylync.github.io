        </div>

        <div class="a">
        <p>My career began after successfully passing my licensure board exam from the Philippines. I
entered the field as a Junior Medical Technologist and learned the basics of the clinical laboratory
areas such as Chemistry, Hematology, Clinical Microscopy, Immunology, Serology and Processing. I
took small steps toward leading my department involving quality assurance roles and inventory
management. During these early years of my career, I built the desire to gain better experiences and
opportunities. It led me to make a life-changing decision: to leave my home country. It was never easy
to leave my family behind, but I knew that I was doing it not only for my professional goals but also to
provide a better future for them.</p>

        <h3>New Beginnings..</h3>
    </div>

        <div class="b">
        <p><img src="images/icons8-uae.png" alt="UAE Flag" class="uae"> Far away from home, my journey as an Overseas Filipino Worker (OFW) started in Abu Dhabi, a
modern city in the middle of the desert. This transition to working abroad wasn’t easy because while
working as a generalist, I was also tasked to lead a laboratory department (Microbiology) where I didn’t
have enough experience at my first facility. Fortunately, my Pathologist was an expert in the field and
was supportive and helped me grow in the role. Through this, I was exposed to regulatory compliance
tasks and requirements, accreditation processes, and inspections for clinical laboratories such as the
CAP and ISO. Both facilities I worked at in the UAE taught me valuable lessons—how to adapt to
diverse teams, to work under pressure, build leadership skills, and improve communication. I believe
that these experiences helped me prepare for the job I had always dreamed of and become a better
version of myself.</p>
            </div>

         <div class="c">
        <p><img src="images/icons8-usa.png" alt="USA" class="usa"> One of my top career goals was working in the U.S. While working in the UAE, I started
gathering experience and preparing my documents and eventually got hired by MedPro. In 2021, I
arrived in the U.S. and began working as a contingent worker through an agency. I decided to stay at
the same hospital (St. Mary’s Hospital) after being offered a full-time position when I finished my
agency contract. Since then, I’ve enjoyed a better work-life balance and discovered my area of interest
and specialties in the laboratory (Chemistry, Hematology, POCT). I have also continued growing my
technical skills with the help of my laboratory leaders and by joining our Clinical Ladder Program,
which allows me to take part in projects, community service, and professional development.</p>

            <div class="d"> 
            <p>Today, I am a graduate student at the University of Missouri, pursuing a Master of Health
Science in Clinical Diagnostic Sciences with an emphasis on Clinical Laboratory Science. I’m also
taking my leadership elective courses for an Online Educator Graduate Certificate. My overall
experience gained me a sense of purpose in my role to deepen my expertise in certain laboratory
departments, lead projects, engage in quality improvement tasks, improving continuing education
access to laboratory professionals and teaching future laboratory professionals or new laboratory
employees. Overall, the journey wasn’t easy, but it was worth it. It has shaped my professional identity
and my commitment to high-quality healthcare services.
