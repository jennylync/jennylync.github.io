     Hello everyone! My name is Jennylyn Capones. I work as a medical laboratory scientist and I’m a beginner in web design and development. While I’m excited to take this course to fulfill the Online Educator graduate certificate, I also feel a bit overwhelmed, as I have no prior experience. Despite being new to this, I’m truly eager to learn and develop these skills. I'm looking forward to teaching online courses or probably even creating a website dedicated to continuing education for my fellow laboratory professionals one day. I believe this course will be a valuable step toward achieving that goal. I'm also looking forward to learning with peers with varying backgrounds and expertise which will enrich the learning experience even more. When I’m not working or studying, I enjoy reading books on my Kindle and binge-watching medical TV shows as a way to relax and unwind.
