        <p>The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase my professional development as a medical laboratory scientist and to create a platform that reflects my expertise, experiences, and aspirations. It aims to highlight my technical competencies, commitment to high quality laboratory practices, and dedication to continuous learning and education. Additionally, I hope that this portfolio will also serve as a resource for peers, students and anyone by offering insights into the vital role laboratory professionals play in healthcare—performing accurate diagnostic testing, ensuring patient safety, and supporting clinical decision.  Ultimately, this will promote professional identity, growth, and connection within and outside the medical laboratory science community.
